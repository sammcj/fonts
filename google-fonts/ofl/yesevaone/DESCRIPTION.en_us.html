A serif display type that is very feminine. 
I think that this is the only type in the world with such a feminine essence. 
Yeseva's name is from the phrase "Yes, Eva." As a sign of complete agreement between a man and a woman.
I dedicate this font to my beloved wife.

Yeseva's design was updated in September 2012, and version 2.0 is 5 percent narrower. 
I added a lot of new characters and refined many of the existing ones.

<b>Updated:</b> January 2016 with a technical fix to the non-breaking-space character.
